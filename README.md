# ShyshCTL
A very helpful utility that describes every kernel parameters displayed by sysctl in a pretty way..

---
Description: >-
This utility uses [**tgpt**](https://github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt) binary to use the Ai LLM , to fetch the description of the all the kernel parameters we see while using the 'sysctl' linux command , while people can manually search for all their queries , but I took this to one step ahead . By helping linux users to have a good interaction and better understanding of the OS.

## Usage

Just (chmod +x) the install.sh file and run it with superuser privs. (this will download the linux compatible tgpt binary into your /usr/bin/ directory as well as the ShyshCTL binary in the /usr/bin) ..
